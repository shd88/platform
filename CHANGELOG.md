## Release v0.7.0 (Beta1) 

Released 2015-09-05

### Release Highlights

#### Improved GitLab Mattermost support 

Following the release of Mattermost v0.6.0 Alpha, GitLab 7.14 offered an automated install of Mattermost with GitLab Single-Sign-On (co-branded as "GitLab Mattermost") in its omnibus installer.

New features, improvements, and bug fixes recommended by the GitLab community were incorporated into Mattermost v0.7.0 Beta1--in particular, extending support of GitLab SSO to team creation, and restricting team creation to users with verified emails from a configurable list of domains.

#### Slack Import (Preview)

Preview of Slack import functionality supports the processing of an "Export" file from Slack containing account information and public channel archives from a Slack team.   

- In the feature preview, emails and usernames from Slack are used to create new Mattermost accounts, which users can activate by going to the Password Reset screen in Mattermost to set new credentials. 
- Once logged in, users will have access to previous Slack messages shared in public channels, now imported to Mattermost.  

Limitations: 

- Slack does not export files or images your team has stored in Slack's database. Mattermost will provide links to the location of your assets in Slack's web UI.
- Slack does not export any content from private groups or direct messages that your team has stored in Slack's database. 
- The Preview release of Slack Import does not offer pre-checks or roll-back and will not import Slack accounts with username or email address collisions with existing Mattermost accounts. Also, Slack channel names with underscores will not import. Also, mentions do not yet resolve as Mattermost usernames (still show Slack ID). These issues are being addressed in [Mattermost v0.8.0 Migration Support](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/PLT-22?filter=10002).

### New Features 

GitLab Mattermost 

- Ability to create teams using GitLab SSO (previously GitLab SSO only supported account creation and sign-in)
- Ability to restrict team creation to GitLab SSO and/or users with email verified from a specific list of domains.

File and Image Sharing 

- New drag-and-drop file sharing to messages and comments 
- Ability to paste images from clipboard to messages and comments 

Messaging, Comments and Notifications 

- Send messages faster with from optimistic posting and retry on failure 

Documentation 

- New style guidelines for Go, React and Javascript 

### Improvements

Messaging, Comments and Notifications 

- Performance improvements to channel rendering
- Added "Unread posts" in left hand sidebar when notification indicator is off-screen

Documentation 

- Install documentation improved based on early adopter feedback

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed multiple issues with GitLab SSO, installation and on-boarding
